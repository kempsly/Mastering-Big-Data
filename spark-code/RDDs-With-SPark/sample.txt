# Sample Data for Spark Processing

This is a sample text file that we can use for Spark processing in Databricks or any Spark environment.

- Spark is a powerful distributed computing system.
- It is used for big data processing and analytics.
- You can use Spark for batch and real-time data processing.

Below are some random numbers and strings to simulate varied data:

1234, 5678, 91011
hello world
spark, big data, processing, analytics

Here are some JSON-like data entries:
{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Los Angeles"}
{"name": "Bob", "age": 28, "city": "Chicago"}

Let's use this file to test Spark transformations.
