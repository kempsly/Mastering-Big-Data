This is a sample text file for testing the Hadoop MapReduce job.
The file contains multiple lines of text to demonstrate the word count functionality.
Each line of text will be processed by the MapReduce job to count the occurrences of each word.
The output will show the frequency of each word in the file.
This is a great way to test the Hadoop MapReduce job and ensure it is working correctly.
