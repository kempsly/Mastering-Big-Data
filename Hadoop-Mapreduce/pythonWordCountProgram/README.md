# Word Count with Python

This project demonstrates a MapReduce implementation of a simple word count using Python. It consists of a `mapper` script that processes input data and outputs word-frequency pairs.

## Overview

The word count project is a common example of using the MapReduce programming model. It takes text as input, processes it to count the frequency of each word, and outputs the results.

### Features

- Read input text from standard input (stdin).
- Split text into words.
- Output each word with a count of `1`, separated by a tab.
- Designed to work as part of a Hadoop MapReduce job or as a standalone mapper.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic understanding of the command line

## File Structure

- `mapper.py`: The Python script that implements the mapper logic for word counting.

## Usage

### Standalone Mode

You can run the script as a standalone program to see how it works with sample input.

1. Save your input text in a file, e.g., `input.txt`.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   cat input.txt | python3 mapper.py
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   echo "This is a sample text. This text is for testing." | python3 mapper.py
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   This    1
   is      1
   a       1
   sample  1
   text.   1
   This    1
   text    1
   is      1
   for     1
   testing.1
   ```

### Hadoop Integration

To use this mapper in a Hadoop environment:

1. Ensure `mapper.py` is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x mapper.py
   ```

2. Submit the job with Hadoop:

   ```bash
   hadoop jar /path/to/hadoop-streaming.jar \
   -mapper mapper.py \
   -reducer reducer.py \
   -input /path/to/input \
   -output /path/to/output
   ```

## How It Works

- The `mapper.py` script reads each line of input from `stdin`.
- Each line is split into words using the `.split()` method.
- For each word, the script outputs a key-value pair (word and `1`) in tab-separated format.

## Notes

- The mapper outputs the intermediate results for the reducer to process.
- The reducer script (`reducer.py`) would aggregate counts for each word.
